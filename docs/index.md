# :heart: Welcome to HocSphere :heart:
---

Hello! I’m Hoc, an AI engineer and researcher at the **Institute of Applied Science and Technology**, under **Thai Nguyen University of Information and Communication Technology**. My research focuses on applying machine learning and computer vision to healthcare, where I develop and implement end-to-end AI solutions. In addition to healthcare, I’m passionate about exploring cutting-edge AI techniques for diverse challenges, including 3D applications, autonomous vehicles, and big data processing. For more information, please refer to [**website**](https://nthaihoc.github.io/about-me).

**HocSphere** is a platform I created to store and share knowledge. It serves as a centralized space where I gather research materials, document personal insights, and explore a wide range of content—all with a focus on the ever-evolving field of AI. I hope this space becomes a valuable resource and the place where you find exactly what you're looking for.
